In each folders you will find a "common" folder or file.
These only serve for entities that share the same ressources, avoiding double files

common files are :

- shared sound effects between entities (hit se, item attribute)
- entities that only need 1-2 sounds to fully function (items are forbidden)

Try avoiding putting the same sound for another ennemy in it's respective folder.
Save as much space as possible



------ Phantom Ganon --------



It will be one kind to programm, since music will be dynamic with this one (depending on hit-rate, success and failure)
and might be the only one atm

phantom ganon has 5 music variation when it come to energy ball exchange (tennis)

for i = 1 .. 5 do
  if blabla exchange = 1 .. 5 then
  return i
play_music(i)
end
end

for the failure : hero:on_taking_damage will help
play_music(failure,function()
play_music(loop)end)

looks simple but not really ...
