This is going to be the next thing after Epona.

So, as stated by other, Titlescreen must be a surface-only drawables.
But, I have some idea to counter this and make the titlescreen a map thing.

- in main.lua, check if a file "save0" exist, if not, create it with as starting location the desired map
- when the titlescreen start, game:start(save0)
- handle the titlescreen from the map script
- when start is pressed, go to file selection
