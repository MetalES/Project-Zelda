It will be one kind to programm, since music will be dynamic with this one (depending on hit-rate, success and failure)
and might be the only one atm

phantom ganon has 5 music variation when it come to energy ball exchange (tennis)

each time PG send back the ball, increment the music value.

for the failure : hero:on_taking_damage will help
play_music(failure,function()
play_music(loop)end)

looks simple but not really ...
