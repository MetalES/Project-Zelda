# ZeldaES-Solarus-Edition
Port from RPG Maker to the Solarus Engine.
Files are incomplete but this is wanted, game will be playable when there will be "main.lua" in /data.

Do not ask for any feature request, the game already had enough feature to programm, and it's already a mess. /ffs

#Planned

- Horse, with archery and sword, similar to Twilight Princess
- More items (Megaton Hammer, FSA styled rod, roc's cape, net, bottle overhaul, etc)
- overhauled maps (compared to the RPG Maker's map)
- Minigames, somes are already made.
- Bosses (you might spoil yourself if you go on /data/music/dungeons/boss)
- PSP port (but this one might take a while, let's focus on the game itself)
