# Solarus : Project Zelda

/!\ <DISCLAIMER> /!\

This project is made for free and for educationnal purposes only as an attempt to learn how video game making works.

There is a lot of stuffs not uploaded on the GIT, I wanna keep them safely before the release of the demo. (Approx. Summer 2016)
You will find some basic stuffs here and there though.
You can take anything you wants here, but do not forget to credit authors for their works on the taken object. (See at the end of this readme).
I decline every responsabilities that my scripts represents, if that make crashs in yours. They are still in their early phase.
Don't ask me to fix the git if the file you downloaded provide errors in your quest, they'll be automatically fixed, patience is the key.

/!\ </DISCLAIMER> /!\
