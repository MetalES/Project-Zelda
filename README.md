# ZeldaES-Solarus-Edition
Port from RPG Maker to the Solarus Engine.
Files are incomplete but this is wanted, game will be playable when there will be "main.lua" in /data.

Repo Update rate : each week.
Advancement tracking : each major version.

Do not ask for any feature request, the game already had enough feature to programm, and it's already a mess. /ffs

- Worked on some maps, World tileset is now from Parallel Worlds too. Most of these  are test rooms.
- Bow and arrows have a fully new fonctionnality, comparable to Four Swords Adventure or 3D Zelda, with alterations (can't pause while using items)
- 3D Zelda styled chests are implemented (animation before geting item), thanks to Christopho and Diarantor
- Reworked HUD
- Reworked Dialog Box, much wider
- Reworked Dialog Icons, now supports 32x32 format, allows more pixel for items when showing them.
- Chests can spawn like they spawn in OOT and M'sM if a enigma is solved (the round thing around the chest and then fade in)
- Files are hierarchised in folders, organisation wise, it was a mess in the RPG Maker version to find files.
