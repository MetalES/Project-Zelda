->Current build<- : Unplayable, scripts missing

Don't ask me to fix the git if the file you downloaded provide errors in your quest, they'll be automatically fixed, patience is the key.

Repo Update rate : Each Week.
Advancement tracking : each major version.

Do not ask for any feature request, the game already had enough feature to programm, and it's already a mess. /ffs
